## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or Atlas account)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone your GitHub Classroom repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment examples
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   ```
4. Set up test database:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-test-db
   ```

### Running the Application
```bash
# Start both client and server in development mode
npm run dev

# Start server only
npm run server:dev

# Start client only
npm run client:dev
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run only end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

- ✅ LoginForm component unit tests (client/src/tests/unit/LoginForm.test.jsx)
- [ ] Add more component tests
- [ ] Add utility function tests
- [ ] Add middleware tests
- [ ] Add custom hook tests

### Task 3: Integration Testing
**Requirements:**
- [ ] Write tests for API endpoints using Supertest
- [ ] Test database operations with a test database
- [ ] Implement integration tests for React components that interact with APIs

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ User routes integration tests (server/tests/integration/user.routes.test.js)
- [ ] Task routes integration tests
- [ ] Client-side API integration tests
- [ ] Authentication flow tests
- [ ] Form validation tests

### Task 4: End-to-End Testing
**Requirements:**
- [ ] Set up Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end testing
- [ ] Create tests for critical user flows (e.g., registration, login, CRUD operations)
- [ ] Test navigation and routing
- [ ] Implement tests for error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Create visual regression tests for UI components

**Current Progress:**
- ✅ Cypress configuration and setup
- ✅ Authentication flow E2E tests (client/cypress/e2e/auth.cy.js)
- [ ] Task management E2E tests
- [ ] Navigation E2E tests
- [ ] Error handling E2E tests

### Task 5: Debugging Techniques
**Requirements:**
- [ ] Use logging strategies for server-side debugging
- [ ] Implement error boundaries in React
- [ ] Use browser developer tools for client-side debugging
